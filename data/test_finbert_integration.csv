1kvunr3,"I‚Äôm Chris, founder of Spritz ‚Äì we help you live off your crypto (including Moons). AMA!","Hey r/CryptoCurrency üëã

I‚Äôm Chris, founder of Spritz ‚Äì a platform built to help you actually live off your crypto without touching a centralized exchange or bank.

We make it easy to:

* Pay bills (credit card, rent, phone, ‚Ä¶) directly with any crypto
* Off-ramp to your bank account instantly
* Spend anywhere with a non-custodial Visa card

We‚Äôve been building Spritz for a while, but earlier this year we took a big step back to rebuild the product from the ground up ‚Äì and now we‚Äôre launching something I‚Äôm really proud of:

We‚Äôre dropping the **new Spritz Card** on June 1st (US only at launch), powered by Rain. It's non-custodial, comes with Visa Signature perks, and you can top it up with any token ‚Äî **including Moons** (see screenshot below).

[Funding the Spritz Card with Moons](https://preview.redd.it/xed675ino43f1.png?width=1092&format=png&auto=webp&s=146ed7bc8f6c8c41167eed20ff5750edc576fcda)

üö® Bonus for r/CryptoCurrency: The first 100 users to join the Spritz Card waitlist will get a free $5 top-up at launch üëâ[ ](https://app.spritz.finance/?promo=reddit5)[join here](https://app.spritz.finance/card?promo=reddit5).

We want to show what crypto utility really looks like and we‚Äôre excited to hear your thoughts.

Ask me anything about:

* Building and rebuilding Spritz
* How crypto off-ramps and payments work behind the scenes
* Real-world DeFi use cases (yes, people really pay their mortgage with crypto!)
* How we built Spritz to support any token, including meme coins, long-tail assets, and now Moons
* Where we think crypto cards are heading and how we're different from Coinbase or [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com)
* Or anything else on your mind

I‚Äôll be hanging out and answering questions all day. AMA!

https://preview.redd.it/tvo95bxilg3f1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=abd4711aa6001ad45d8033a873778c8480ca2b12

  
As you can see in the image above, we are witnessing more than just a little pump in price, we are witnessing how Ethereum's ecosystem keeps growing non stop and coming more alive than ever and data is here to prove it.

For example, active addresses are holding around 15 million which is a strong indicator that more users are interacting with the network and not just speculating with it. (Some will say here that they are a few persons with multiple wallets, FUDers)

Regarding multi chain users, they have increased by 9.4% hitting 617k. This showing again that people are not sticking to one chain and they are enjoying and exploring the broader Ethereum Universe from Arbitrum to Base to zkSync, etc.

Furthermore, Layer 2 dominance is up 5.8% showing that more activity is migrating off the mainnet on to efficient cost effective rollups. This is really good for scaling and its a sign of real adoption.

As you can see, Ethereum ecosystem is more alive than ever and its aligning perfectly with the current bullish momentum. This is not just whales playing games, this is organic growth happening under the hood. We are witnessing Ethereum evolution.

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can‚Äôt be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](https://imgur.com/a/5w3l2A6) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://river.com/learn/how-bitcoin-fees-work/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://aggr.trade/1m1h) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth 
--------------|--------|------------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A 
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | 

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out.

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of ¬£/$/‚Ç¨), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | ŒºBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

1kxcm7k,I made a hardware device to store seed phrases physically ‚Äî no need to punch steel,"**Hey everyone** 

I‚Äôve been thinking about how to securely back up a crypto seed without having to engrave it into steel or rely on other irreversible methods.

So I came up with my own solution ‚Äî and built a working prototype.

# üí° How it works:

1. Plug the device into your computer via USB and click¬†**‚ÄúGenerate Seed‚Äù**.
2. The device lights up specific holes using red LEDs ‚Äî those are where you need to insert screws.
3. Just insert the screws into the lit-up holes.
4. Each screw represents a binary bit, which together form BIP39 seed words.
5. On-screen, you‚Äôll see a progress bar for each of the 12 words ‚Äî showing how many screws are still missing.

‚úÖ¬†**No technical knowledge required**

‚úÖ¬†**Mistake-proof**¬†‚Äî if you insert a screw in the wrong place, the software warns you

‚úÖ¬†**Seed never leaves the device**¬†‚Äî it‚Äôs securely stored in an Optiga chip, just like in a Trezor

# üîÅ Benefits:

‚Ä¢¬†**Reusable**¬†‚Äî want to change the seed? Just remove the screws and start over

‚Ä¢¬†**Secure**¬†‚Äî the seed is never exposed to your computer or software

‚Ä¢¬†**Error-proof**¬†‚Äî you can‚Äôt get it wrong; the device guides you

‚Ä¢¬†**Quick to ‚Äúdestroy‚Äù**¬†‚Äî moving a few screws is enough to make the seed unreadable

‚Ä¢¬†**Fire/water-resistant**¬†‚Äî even if the electronics are destroyed, the screw positions remain and the seed can be reconstructed

(The case is made of bead-blasted stainless steel)

‚Ä¢¬†**Shamir backup ready**¬†‚Äî 5 extra holes at the bottom right are used to label which share this device represents (e.g. 3 of 5)

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Downsides (for now):

‚Ä¢¬†**Tiny screws**¬†‚Äî working with 2mm screws isn‚Äôt the most convenient

‚Ä¢¬†**Contact reliability**¬†‚Äî this is still a prototype; sometimes screws need to be re-tightened to ensure contact

Ideally, this could one day work directly with a hardware wallet. It's just a small side project I've been working on. I would love to know what you are thinking about. Does it even make sense?

1kx2n01,"About to dump my real estate ""investment"" to BTC","Eight years ago, I fell for the popular advice: ‚ÄúReal estate is the best investment,‚Äù ‚Äúprices only go up,‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs a hedge against inflation.‚Äù So I bought an apartment. I bought it at a 20% discount below market value because I got it from a grand parent. He told me to look the cheapest in the area and discount 20% off and that would be the price. What a slam dunk, right?

Five years in, I tried to sell. My realtor told me to leave it empty because ‚Äúrented homes take longer to sell.‚Äù So I left it vacant. A full year. No rent. Just sitting there. Eventually, frustrated, I rented it out again for two more years.

Fast forward to now: I just sold it. And to my luck (again) I sold it for more than what new properties in the area are going for, even though this apartment is 13 years old.  It was even above what my agent said I could ever get. So I bought at the lowest price possible, and I sold at the highest price possible.


I did my numbers and still I lost money.

How?

1. Appreciation was a myth. The so-called ‚Äúgain‚Äù barely beat inflation, and certainly didn‚Äôt compensate for the time, risk, or more importantly opportunity cost.


2. Vacancy and maintenance wasn't hell but hurt my returns. I lost rental income for a year, because market wasn't active when I wanted to sell. paid fees, taxes to buy, taxes to keep and taxes to sell. 


Now here‚Äôs where Bitcoin comes in.

I have been buying Btc since 2017. Haven't sold any. But have invested peanuts Compared to this apparment. With btc, I don‚Äôt deal with broken pipes or flaky tenants. I don‚Äôt need a real estate agent to ‚Äúconvince‚Äù someone to overpay.

With Bitcoin, I own it. It‚Äôs mine. It‚Äôs liquid. It‚Äôs borderless. It doesn‚Äôt age, it doesn‚Äôt rot, and I can send it in a second to anyone in the world. And despite the volatility, I‚Äôve never lost sleep over it the way I have over real estate.

I‚Äôm 35 now, and feel like I lost 8 years of financial race in this stupid play. 

I learned this lesson the hard way, but I share it in case someone else is being told the same myths I was when younger. Real estate is not always the safe bet they make it out to be. And for me, Bitcoin makes a hell of a lot more sense.

I will now dump all the proceeds to multiply my stats, even at the all time high. And will surely sleep like a baby tonight

1kucrna,Could something like Proof of Growth actually work in crypto?,"Lately I‚Äôve been thinking about how value is created in crypto, and more specifically, who creates it in the early stages of a project.

Most of the time it is not capital. It is not speculation. It is people. People who explain the idea before it is popular. People who make tools or fix bugs without being asked. People who translate, design, write, moderate, connect. These early contributors often build the surface area that the rest of the system eventually stands on.

But when value arrives, they are rarely part of it. They are either forgotten or remembered informally. There is no reliable way to track contribution or reward it with any structure. Unless you were part of the founding group or already close to the token, you are usually left out.

We have Proof of Work. We have Proof of Stake. We even have Proof of Attendance. But we do not have anything like Proof of Growth. Nothing that tries to formally recognize who helped a protocol grow in its earliest and most fragile moments.

I am wondering if that is even possible. Can growth be measured? Can contribution be recorded without turning it into a bounty system or a grant application? Can it happen on-chain, without relying on social memory or central teams?

Just trying to understand whether anyone has seen this done well. Or whether it is simply too human to turn into a protocol.

1kufwdp,"Ethereum has staking, governance, and $500M launches. Still no way to reward people who actually helped.","Think about it.

Most of the value in early Ethereum projects didn‚Äôt come from investors. It came from contributors.  
Writers. Meme makers. Hackers. People in Telegram chats trying to explain things before there was even a whitepaper. Translators who never got paid. Mods who dealt with messes when no one else wanted to.

And then what?

Usually nothing.

Maybe a thank you. Maybe airdrop if they were lucky. Usually ignored.

Meanwhile protocols are raising $50M and building ‚Äúcommunity treasuries‚Äù with no actual community memory. Just wallets and vibes.

Ethereum is a coordination layer. So why can‚Äôt we coordinate this?

Still no native system to track contribution. Not activity. Not speculation. Actual contribution. The stuff that makes people care. That makes projects work.

We built entire financial layers and forgot the people who made the ground floor livable.

Brutal.

Everyone talks about on-chain rep. But no one‚Äôs actually using it.
