1kvunr3,"I‚Äôm Chris, founder of Spritz ‚Äì we help you live off your crypto (including Moons). AMA!","Hey r/CryptoCurrency üëã

I‚Äôm Chris, founder of Spritz ‚Äì a platform built to help you actually live off your crypto without touching a centralized exchange or bank.

We make it easy to:

* Pay bills (credit card, rent, phone, ‚Ä¶) directly with any crypto
* Off-ramp to your bank account instantly
* Spend anywhere with a non-custodial Visa card

We‚Äôve been building Spritz for a while, but earlier this year we took a big step back to rebuild the product from the ground up ‚Äì and now we‚Äôre launching something I‚Äôm really proud of:

We‚Äôre dropping the **new Spritz Card** on June 1st (US only at launch), powered by Rain. It's non-custodial, comes with Visa Signature perks, and you can top it up with any token ‚Äî **including Moons** (see screenshot below).

[Funding the Spritz Card with Moons](https://preview.redd.it/xed675ino43f1.png?width=1092&format=png&auto=webp&s=146ed7bc8f6c8c41167eed20ff5750edc576fcda)

üö® Bonus for r/CryptoCurrency: The first 100 users to join the Spritz Card waitlist will get a free $5 top-up at launch üëâ[ ](https://app.spritz.finance/?promo=reddit5)[join here](https://app.spritz.finance/card?promo=reddit5).

We want to show what crypto utility really looks like and we‚Äôre excited to hear your thoughts.

Ask me anything about:

* Building and rebuilding Spritz
* How crypto off-ramps and payments work behind the scenes
* Real-world DeFi use cases (yes, people really pay their mortgage with crypto!)
* How we built Spritz to support any token, including meme coins, long-tail assets, and now Moons
* Where we think crypto cards are heading and how we're different from Coinbase or [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com)
* Or anything else on your mind

I‚Äôll be hanging out and answering questions all day. AMA!

https://preview.redd.it/tvo95bxilg3f1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=abd4711aa6001ad45d8033a873778c8480ca2b12

  
As you can see in the image above, we are witnessing more than just a little pump in price, we are witnessing how Ethereum's ecosystem keeps growing non stop and coming more alive than ever and data is here to prove it.

For example, active addresses are holding around 15 million which is a strong indicator that more users are interacting with the network and not just speculating with it. (Some will say here that they are a few persons with multiple wallets, FUDers)

Regarding multi chain users, they have increased by 9.4% hitting 617k. This showing again that people are not sticking to one chain and they are enjoying and exploring the broader Ethereum Universe from Arbitrum to Base to zkSync, etc.

Furthermore, Layer 2 dominance is up 5.8% showing that more activity is migrating off the mainnet on to efficient cost effective rollups. This is really good for scaling and its a sign of real adoption.

As you can see, Ethereum ecosystem is more alive than ever and its aligning perfectly with the current bullish momentum. This is not just whales playing games, this is organic growth happening under the hood. We are witnessing Ethereum evolution.

1kx1gra,Is my friend getting scammed ?,"Hello fine people ! I came to the experts to ask about a friend who recently got into crypto and explained to me something who raised red flags. Please excuse any error on my part, I'm not a crypto bro, just a concerned friend.

So my friend was advised by another friend of him that he met online (supposedly a while ago and definitely not a scammer...).

That guy explained to him something called smart contract mining and that he could win passive income.

So he showed me his apps and explained the steps he was instructed to take. He installed an app called Bitget wallet. He set up a wallet and bought ETH on it. He then transferred it to USD tokens ? (Why not start with those? Is he not paying transactions ?)

Then there is like an internet browser inside that app, and on there he goes to a website. That can see all is capital from his wallet ! Is this normal ? And apparently his capital is used to mine ETH, and he talked about profits that seems way too much. Apparently he could withdraw anytime ?

He did have to give some sort of access to the miner site, but couldn't tell me 100% that the access is safe. 

Is he right to trust his friend  and the app/site/whole process or is this a scam ? Should I stop him? I never seen him mention that kind of money before and I'm afraid he will loose it.

Also for clarification the money shown in the capital on the site is also still shown in his app capital.

Please also let me know if I'm being stupid here and all that is legit.",6,1748386536,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1kx1gra/is_my_friend_getting_scammed/,41,neutral,0.5,

I've been in crypto for a few years now and have seen how the market tends to follow certain patterns ‚Äî especially the infamous ""alt season"" that usually follows a Bitcoin run. But here we are in May 2025, and despite BTC reaching new highs earlier this year, there's been almost no real sign of an altcoin season.

I have my doubts about this, my felling is pessimist. We are in May and nothing signal for a big pump in alt coins. The closest we got to this was in December, when a big pump in IA and Agent IA. 

I wanna know about you what‚Äôs your opinion about this, if we have a altcoin season, if haven‚Äôt a alto in season or if you, like me, don‚Äôt have a clearly opinion?

1kws5g8,USDC or Lightning?,"I‚Äôve been following the rollout of **Steak n Shake‚Äôs new Bitcoin terminals** (which is wild, honestly) and noticed a pretty healthy debate on X (Twitter) about which cryptocurrency option will ultimately become the go-to for businesses‚Äîparticularly small businesses.

On one hand, we‚Äôve got the **Lightning Network**, a scaling solution for Bitcoin that enables faster, cheaper transactions. On the other hand, there are **stablecoins** like **USDC** (which major payment processors like **Stripe** and **Square Pay** have signaled support for). This begs the question: **if you‚Äôre a small business owner, which option makes more sense?**



Here‚Äôs the debate as I see it at this point:

**‚ö° Lightning Network**

* Pros: Near-instant transactions with super low fees (we‚Äôre talking fractions of a cent). It‚Äôs directly tied to Bitcoin, which could attract die-hard BTC enthusiasts. Also, there‚Äôs the narrative that ‚ÄúBitcoin is sound money,‚Äù and some people genuinely prefer paying in BTC.
* Cons: Lightning is still somewhat niche with specific wallets needed. The user experience for both merchants and customers can be clunky compared to traditional credit card systems. There‚Äôs also the price volatility of Bitcoin itself, which can be a headache for businesses trying to manage cash flow.

**üíµ Stablecoins (like USDC)**

* Pros: Stablecoins offer price stability (1 USDC = $1), which businesses love. Plus, big processors like Stripe and Square Pay are making it easier to integrate USDC into existing systems. For customers, paying with a dollar-pegged coin feels more intuitive and less risky than paying with Bitcoin.
* Cons: Depending on how payments are handled, there might still be crypto-specific complexity. Also, stablecoins are only as stable as the regulations and companies backing them. USDC, for example, has been through some ups and downs with market perception.



**Why does this matter?**

For small businesses‚Äîthink your local coffee shop, indie retailer, or service provider‚Äîthe decision of which crypto payment option to integrate isn‚Äôt just about technical features. It‚Äôs about **ease of use**, **customer demand**, **fees**, **regulatory compliance**, and the potential **future-proofing** of their payment systems.

As far as I can tell, both **Stripe** and **Square** are moving toward supporting **both Lightning and stablecoins**, so merchants might not have to choose one or the other eventually. But for now, adoption on the Lightning side seems slower outside of Bitcoin-heavy communities, whereas **USDC and other stablecoins are gaining more traction with mainstream payment platforms**.

Personally, I think we‚Äôll see small businesses favor stablecoins in the short term, since they‚Äôre more aligned with how people already think about money. **Lightning might become more appealing as the technology matures and the Bitcoin narrative continues to gain traction.**

I‚Äôm curious what the /cryptocurrency community thinks. **If you ran a small business and had to choose between accepting Bitcoin Lightning payments or stablecoins like USDC, which would you pick and why?** Are there other options I should be considering?



Also, if anyone has experience using either in a real-world business, I‚Äôd love to hear about your experience.

1kwcnrp,Australian Investors ‚Äì Have You Experienced Issues with Layer One X (L1X)? Looking to Connect.,"Hi everyone,

I'm an early investor in Layer One X (L1X), having participated in the 2023 presale via their official channels. Since then, I‚Äôve encountered a number of serious concerns that may impact not just myself, but other Australian participants as well.

Some of the key issues include:  
‚Ä¢ Unilateral extension of vesting periods post-purchase  
‚Ä¢ Locked tokens in the ‚ÄúRelease Pool‚Äù without an exit path  
‚Ä¢ Inconsistent or misleading claims around cross-chain interoperability  
‚Ä¢ Smart contract logic that appears to contradict public explanations  
‚Ä¢ Rewards being issued in BSC USDT regardless of purchase origin  
‚Ä¢ Alleged token sales at a price significantly higher than the actual market rate

I‚Äôm currently in the process of documenting these issues and potentially preparing a submission to ASIC. In doing so, I‚Äôm hoping to connect with other Australian investors who may have experienced similar concerns. Details in the comments below.

To keep things organized, I‚Äôve created a short intake form to gather shared experiences. The form is private, non-commercial, and purely for coordination in case group action or regulatory contact is required.

Thanks in advance ‚Äî even one more data point could make a difference.",2,1748314033,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1kwcnrp/australian_investors_have_you_experienced_issues/,2,neutral,0.5,
1kvrj7f,How Much Bitcoin Do CEXs Keep in Their Reserves?,"In the wake of the new $111k Bitcoin ATH I was checking some odd BTC statistics and i saw a statement about CEXs BTC PoR ratio.

When Gateio introduced¬†**Proof of Reserve (PoR)**¬†it wasn't really taken seriously until after the disasters FTX... then attention shifted and questions were asked if & where CEXs stash their digital cash.

PoR have been a good measure of transparency standards of CEXs in recent times and digging deeper, the top five that published their PoR have above 100%, which is a win for anyone using them.

https://preview.redd.it/bji0k1kxx33f1.png?width=1064&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea18674e4516990e05ba54a380af2bb493aa17a7

Binance is just over the line at 100.77%, while OKX and MEXC show solid buffers at 114% and 117.53%. Bybit‚Äôs 104.4% is also reassuring.

But then there‚Äôs¬†**Bitget**, with insane 369%, it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre shouting....  
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got you covered""  
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got you covered""  
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got you covered"" + 69%...

As crypto grows up, I expect PoR to become a must-have, not a bonus. For now, it‚Äôs cool to see these big names leading the charge.

1kv9gzz,What to do after family members death?,"My brother‚Äôs wife passed on Friday due to Stage 4 Gastric Cancer. 

She has crypto accounts & a Trezor wallet. My brother does have access to all of these accounts. 

We live in New Jersey. She had no will. She left behind my brother and 2 small children. 

Is he allowed to hold or sell any of said crypto if it‚Äôs her account and he is next of kin? 

We are just trying to figure out how to handle anything post death, as everything is connected to her social security number with these apps and wallets, I assume. 

Is he allowed to sell if he needs money to care for the kids, due to NJ intestacy laws (no will)? 

Does all of the crypto die with my sister in law? 

Just trying to help him get answers as we are all trying to figure out the things that need to be taken care of to set the kids up for the future. 

Thank you for any advice/help.

According to this graph next dip should be in 2026.

If that dip drops -75% in 2026 that would mean, Bitcoin is expected to be cheaper in 2026 than it is today ($110,000) unless Bitcoin climbs above $440,000 by the end of this year.

This is highly speculative, trying to predict the market but if the cycle repeats these numbers are quite a food for thought if today in particular is a good day to stack those sats in favour of 2026.

1jwz2d3,Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ - Please read!,"# Welcome to the /r/Bitcoin Newcomers FAQ

You've probably been hearing a lot about Bitcoin recently and are wondering what's the big deal?  Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  

It all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:

## Key properties of Bitcoin

* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.
* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.
* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).
* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  
* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).
* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.
* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/).
* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.
* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. 
* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can‚Äôt be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.
* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met
* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. 
* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. 
* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).
* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](https://imgur.com/a/5w3l2A6) better than gold or fiat.
* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).
* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://river.com/learn/how-bitcoin-fees-work/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.
* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.

## Where can I buy bitcoin?

[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.

* [Strike](https://strike.me/)
* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)
* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)
* [River Financial](https://river.com/)
* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) 
* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) 
* [Relai](https://relai.app/)
* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)
* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)
* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)
* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)
* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)
* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)

You can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin try [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  

**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://aggr.trade/1m1h) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. 

## Securing your bitcoin

With Bitcoin you can **""Be your own bank""** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **""Bitcoin banks""** which will hold your bitcoin for you.

* If you prefer to **""Be your own bank""** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).

* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.

* If you prefer to work with third party **""Bitcoin banks""** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **""Not your keys, not your coins""**. 

**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** 

2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.

**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called ""SIM swapping"" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.

Google Auth | Authy | OTP Auth 
--------------|--------|------------
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A 
[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | 

Physical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.

## Running Bitcoin

You can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. 

It is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). 

Don't Trust, Verify.

* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases
* https://bitcoincore.org
* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/

A verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). 

For wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.

## Watch out for scams

As mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **""Don't trust, verify""**. 

* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.
* Ignore private messages offering services.
* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.
* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.
* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.

## Can I mine bitcoin?

Mining bitcoin can be a fun learning experience, but be aware that you will most likely operate at a loss.  Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. 

If you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/)

## Bitcoin Units

One bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of ¬£/$/‚Ç¨), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:

Unit | Symbol | Value | Info
---|:---:|---|---
bitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis
millibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet
bit | ŒºBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial ""slang"" term for microbitcoin
satoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor

For example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:

* 0.001 BTC
* 1 mBTC
* 1,000 bits
* 100,000 sats

For more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).

1kx2n01,"About to dump my real estate ""investment"" to BTC","Eight years ago, I fell for the popular advice: ‚ÄúReal estate is the best investment,‚Äù ‚Äúprices only go up,‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs a hedge against inflation.‚Äù So I bought an apartment. I bought it at a 20% discount below market value because I got it from a grand parent. He told me to look the cheapest in the area and discount 20% off and that would be the price. What a slam dunk, right?

Five years in, I tried to sell. My realtor told me to leave it empty because ‚Äúrented homes take longer to sell.‚Äù So I left it vacant. A full year. No rent. Just sitting there. Eventually, frustrated, I rented it out again for two more years.

Fast forward to now: I just sold it. And to my luck (again) I sold it for more than what new properties in the area are going for, even though this apartment is 13 years old.  It was even above what my agent said I could ever get. So I bought at the lowest price possible, and I sold at the highest price possible.


I did my numbers and still I lost money.

How?

1. Appreciation was a myth. The so-called ‚Äúgain‚Äù barely beat inflation, and certainly didn‚Äôt compensate for the time, risk, or more importantly opportunity cost.


2. Vacancy and maintenance wasn't hell but hurt my returns. I lost rental income for a year, because market wasn't active when I wanted to sell. paid fees, taxes to buy, taxes to keep and taxes to sell. 


Now here‚Äôs where Bitcoin comes in.

I have been buying Btc since 2017. Haven't sold any. But have invested peanuts Compared to this apparment. With btc, I don‚Äôt deal with broken pipes or flaky tenants. I don‚Äôt need a real estate agent to ‚Äúconvince‚Äù someone to overpay.

With Bitcoin, I own it. It‚Äôs mine. It‚Äôs liquid. It‚Äôs borderless. It doesn‚Äôt age, it doesn‚Äôt rot, and I can send it in a second to anyone in the world. And despite the volatility, I‚Äôve never lost sleep over it the way I have over real estate.

I‚Äôm 35 now, and feel like I lost 8 years of financial race in this stupid play. 

I learned this lesson the hard way, but I share it in case someone else is being told the same myths I was when younger. Real estate is not always the safe bet they make it out to be. And for me, Bitcoin makes a hell of a lot more sense.

I will now dump all the proceeds to multiply my stats, even at the all time high. And will surely sleep like a baby tonight

I have multiple Bluewallet-created multisig wallets and I want to move one of the devices to Specter. I can't seem to find a direct way to import a wallet from Bluewallet.

If I choose ""Add new wallet"" then import, scan QR code, and bring up the code in BW with ""export coordination setup"" ... the scan doesn't happen no matter how long I hold it in front of the webcam.

So, I chose share in BW and saved the file. When I try to import it: ""Unsupported wallet import format:Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)""

I was able to ""import"" 1 by manually adding each device and the public keys, then creating the wallet from those known keys. None of the keys are labeled so I can see how adding several more will get confusing quickly.

Is there a better way?

1kwv8ye,Knots keeps generating its own Tor Address?,"I cannot get knots to use the hidden service Tor address. It keeps generating its own. Grok says this is a problem,

Why Not Use the Address Bitcoin Knots Generates?Bitcoin Knots can generate its own .onion address by creating a private key (stored in /mnt/ssd/bitcoin-data/onion\_v3\_private\_key) when configured with torcontrol=127.0.0.1:9051. Here‚Äôs why using this address (e.g., vbtlm...) instead of Tor‚Äôs (tj4jw...) is problematic:

1. Standard Approach Relies on Tor‚Äôs Hidden Service:
   * The standard Tor integration for Bitcoin Knots (and Bitcoin Core) involves Tor managing the hidden service via /etc/tor/torrc (HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/bitcoin-service/, HiddenServicePort 8333 127.0.0.1:8333). This creates a stable .onion address (e.g., tj4jw...) that Tor advertises to the network.
   * Knots‚Äô torcontrol is meant to fetch this address from Tor‚Äôs control port (127.0.0.1:9051) and advertise it, ensuring consistency with Tor‚Äôs configuration. When Knots generates its own address (vbtlm...), it bypasses Tor‚Äôs hidden service, leading to a mismatch that can confuse peers or reduce discoverability.
2. Knots‚Äô Address is Unpredictable:
   * Each time we clear /mnt/ssd/bitcoin-data/onion\_v3\_private\_key and restart bitcoind, Knots generates a new .onion address (e.g., q7gqu... ‚Üí qucur... ‚Üí vcjwb... ‚Üí sl4cmn... ‚Üí vbtlm...). This instability makes it hard for peers to consistently connect to your node, as the address changes frequently.
   * Tor‚Äôs hidden service address (tj4jw...) remains stable unless /var/lib/tor/bitcoin-service/ is cleared, providing a reliable endpoint for inbound connections.
3. Control and Management:
   * Tor‚Äôs hidden service is fully managed by the Tor daemon, which handles key storage (/var/lib/tor/bitcoin-service/), network publication, and routing. Knots‚Äô generated address relies on Knots managing the private key, which can lead to conflicts (e.g., Knots recreating onion\_v3\_private\_key) and lacks Tor‚Äôs robust hidden service features.
   * Using Tor‚Äôs address ensures compatibility with the broader Bitcoin-over-Tor ecosystem, where nodes expect Tor-managed hidden services.
4. Previous Issues:
   * Your node previously showed both tj4jw... and obbqipl... addresses, indicating Knots was advertising its own address alongside Tor‚Äôs. This dual-address behavior can split inbound connections or cause peers to connect to the wrong address.
   * The HSDir error (No more HSDir available to query) suggests Tor struggled to publish its hidden service, but Knots‚Äô address generation (e.g., vbtlm...) bypasses this, creating a new address that may not be properly published either.

Can Tor Conform to Bitcoin Knots‚Äô Generated Address?Technically, it‚Äôs not possible to make Tor adopt an onion address generated by Bitcoin Knots (e.g., vbtlm...) because:

1kuei41,"Starting a new job on DeFi company, need some help!","**Hi everyone,**

I'm about to start a new job on June 1st at a company working in DeFi, focused on structuring the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). I already have a decent understanding of blockchain and crypto‚Äîprobably above the average joe, still not enough for the job‚Äîbut I‚Äôd like to deepen my knowledge before I begin.

I‚Äôve heard about Binance Academy, but I‚Äôm wondering if you know of any other free and high-quality courses or resources that could help me prepare. I‚Äôll be working as a **legal financial analyst**, so I‚Äôm not looking to get into the technical, engineering-heavy side of blockchain‚Äîjust the concepts and insights relevant to finance and legal structuring.

Thanks in advance for any recommendations!",7,1748101173,ethereum,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1kuei41/starting_a_new_job_on_defi_company_need_some_help/,8,neutral,0.5,
1kucrna,Could something like Proof of Growth actually work in crypto?,"Lately I‚Äôve been thinking about how value is created in crypto, and more specifically, who creates it in the early stages of a project.

Most of the time it is not capital. It is not speculation. It is people. People who explain the idea before it is popular. People who make tools or fix bugs without being asked. People who translate, design, write, moderate, connect. These early contributors often build the surface area that the rest of the system eventually stands on.

But when value arrives, they are rarely part of it. They are either forgotten or remembered informally. There is no reliable way to track contribution or reward it with any structure. Unless you were part of the founding group or already close to the token, you are usually left out.

We have Proof of Work. We have Proof of Stake. We even have Proof of Attendance. But we do not have anything like Proof of Growth. Nothing that tries to formally recognize who helped a protocol grow in its earliest and most fragile moments.

I am wondering if that is even possible. Can growth be measured? Can contribution be recorded without turning it into a bounty system or a grant application? Can it happen on-chain, without relying on social memory or central teams?

Just trying to understand whether anyone has seen this done well. Or whether it is simply too human to turn into a protocol.

Would be curious to hear your thoughts.",2,1748096513,ethereum,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1kucrna/could_something_like_proof_of_growth_actually/,6,neutral,0.5,

1kufwdp,"Ethereum has staking, governance, and $500M launches. Still no way to reward people who actually helped.","Think about it.

Most of the value in early Ethereum projects didn‚Äôt come from investors. It came from contributors.  
Writers. Meme makers. Hackers. People in Telegram chats trying to explain things before there was even a whitepaper. Translators who never got paid. Mods who dealt with messes when no one else wanted to.

And then what?

Usually nothing.

Maybe a thank you. Maybe airdrop if they were lucky. Usually ignored.

Meanwhile protocols are raising $50M and building ‚Äúcommunity treasuries‚Äù with no actual community memory. Just wallets and vibes.

Ethereum is a coordination layer. So why can‚Äôt we coordinate this?

Still no native system to track contribution. Not activity. Not speculation. Actual contribution. The stuff that makes people care. That makes projects work.

We built entire financial layers and forgot the people who made the ground floor livable.

Brutal.

Everyone talks about on-chain rep. But no one‚Äôs actually using it.

What if Proof of Growth was real?

Not as a buzzword. Not a bounty board. A protocol.

Could it even work? Or is this just something crypto will always cope with and forget?

1. Why does it needs the bisect game in fraud proof?
2. Why can the transactions in the rollup be fast?

Ok for the bisect game, I saw on l2beats that Arbitrum, base and op stack are all using bisect for their fraud proof. I can't understand why, isn't a fraud easily proven by just executing all the transactions and provide the needed l2 state? If that's too much gas for a single l1 block, the challenger can split it themselves, right? I don't see why it needs an interactive bisect game.

For the second, I know that withdrawing to l1 needs several days for the state to be challenged. However, why isn't it also apply to transactions within the rollup? If I transfer money to another account, and later that block got challenged successfully, then my transfer doesn't count, right? So I don't understand how my transfer can be settled before the block itself got settled.

That's all, thanks in advance!",5,1747882748,ethereum,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1ksghat/two_questions_about_optimistic_rollup/,5,neutral,0.5,

1kr4jtp,The number of Ethereum validators with more than 32 ETH in effective balance has surged from May 9 to May 18.,"This growth follows the introduction of **EIP-7251**, which increases the max effective balance from **32 ETH** to a whopping **2,048 ETH**.  
  
Let‚Äôs break it down:

**1/3** **Daily Validator Growth**  
  
‚Ä¢ May 9: \~60   
  
‚Ä¢ May 10: \~115  
  
‚Ä¢ May 11: \~182  
  
‚Ä¢ May 12: \~241  
  
‚Ä¢ May 13: \~329  
  
‚Ä¢ May 14: \~379  
  
‚Ä¢ May 15: \~405  
  
‚Ä¢ May 16: \~451  
  
‚Ä¢ May 17: \~502  
  
‚Ä¢ May 18: \~533  
  
So, the number of validators increased by about **8.9** times over in just **9** days.  
   
Truly staggering results, and it‚Äôs just the beginning.





**2/3**  **Total Effective Balance Rising**  
  
Alongside validator growth, total effective balance (black line) is rising fast as you see.  
  
On average, each validator holds around **563.7 ETH**.  
  
The network is consolidating power into fewer, more capital-efficient validators a big shift in staking economics.





**3/3** Ethereum staking is evolving and this might be a preview of a more efficient, capital-intense future.  
  
It‚Äôs a balancing act between efficiency, security, and decentralization. This upgrade is a major milestone on that journey.

1kq9p48,I tested a new Ethereum on-chain analytics tool with 100x faster SQL queries ‚Äî here‚Äôs what I found,"I recently reviewed a new on-chain analytics platform that stood out for one reason: it‚Äôs fast, and it‚Äôs built in a way that feels genuinely useful for both devs and analysts working on Ethereum.

Key things I liked:

* You can run **real-time SQL queries** across Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, etc.
* Then instantly **turn those queries into GraphQL APIs:** useful for bots, dashboards, alerting systems, etc.
* The data model is clean: ERC20 transfers, swaps, calldata: all decoded and standardized
* Fast indexing, no setup, and it works across chains out of the box

I stress-tested it with a real case study:  
**Tracking liquidity health across multiple chains:** looking at DEX volumes, inflows/outflows by token and protocol over time. It handled it well: fast and flexible especially for querying and serving multi-chain data without dealing with fragmented APIs or manual decoding.

Just to be clear, I‚Äôm not affiliated with the team. I tested the stack and figured it might be useful to others here building dashboards or running analytics on Ethereum.

1kq75dn,Lost Ethereum,"EDIT: after further digging I won't be able to get it back thank you to everyone that tried to help. From what I've been told it's actually the address for a smart contract but in USDT, since I sent Ethereum to it I won't be able to get it back. Thank you for all the help. Sadly I'll just have to take this loss.


Hi everybody. 
So Friday last week I tried to transfer some ETH to my other wallet and it after it had confirmed I realised that the address was wrong and it got sent some where completely different. I sent 0.5045 Eth to this address ""0xf8e81D47203A594245E36C48e151709F0C19fBe8"". 
Does anyone know who owns this address or if there is anyway I could get it back because I really do need it back. 
I know that this has always been a risk with Ethereum but I never really expected it to happen. If anyone can help in anyway I would appreciate it. Thanks ",3,1747645769,ethereum,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1kq75dn/lost_ethereum/,105,neutral,0.5,
1kptdaw,What am I getting wrong about validator  staking?,"Allnodes charges a fee of $5.00 per month to host ETH holders.   That equals $60.  Per year.   
The rate of return seems to be in the neighborhood of 2.3% annually.  
If I stake 32 ETH, and the price remains constant over a year at a cost of $1500 per unit, my total cost would be $48,000.   My gross rate of return would equal 2.3% of that amount or $1104.   
My net return would therefore be $1044 or 2.17%,     Now the return is much better if the price of ETH rises over the year.  I understand that.  Is there anything else that I am missing in terms of an advantage in staking?   Thanks.

1knjlr7,Pectra Pages | +40 upgrade perspectives from Ethereum core devs,"Just published - **Pectra Pages!** \+40 individual upgrade perspectives from Ethereum core devs

Read the [**full post here**](https://stateful.mirror.xyz/XY5jpORV36JXS-qhSzIgGj_S8b5Yoh2rJKmhAvMJOTc) on Mirror - prompts and summary responses below!

\---------------------------------

**a. Pectra successes:**¬†What has the core development process handled well? Consider timelines, scoping, dividing the fork, testnet incidents, coordinating on ACD, etc.

*The core development process was largely successful in the final mainnet launch. Many respondents highlighted the impressive collaboration and coordination between client teams, especially during the challenging testnet incidents like Holesky and Sepolia, and the swift responses to those issues were seen as positive.*

**b. Pectra improvements:**¬†What should the core protocol community have done better?

*A significant point of consensus was that the scoping of Pectra was too ambitious, leading to complexity, delays, and increased engineering effort. Many suggested the community should focus on smaller, more targeted forks in the future and improve the process of estimating EIP implementation effort and impact.*

**c. Pectra contributions:**¬†Do you have any contributions that you (or your team) are particularly proud of?

*Contributions varied, but notable mentions included work on Max Effective Balance (Max EB) for reducing network load, performance optimizations in clients, and the development of testing and analysis tools like Assertoor and Contributoor, which significantly aided the upgrade process.*

**d. Pectra challenges:**¬†If you worked on previous forks, how did this fork's testnet difficulties compare to previous fork testnet experiences? What were the most challenging bits of Pectra testnets? e.g. technical complexities, social coordination, unexpected timelines, difficult bugs

*The Pectra testnets were widely considered more difficult than previous forks due to the sheer number of EIPs and unexpected bugs, particularly the non-finality issues on Holesky. The coordination overhead and the feeling of a lack of a central focus compared to previous upgrades were also noted as challenges.*

**e. Pectra kudos:**¬†Is there someone whose work you particularly appreciated, or you feel went above and beyond? What did you specifically appreciate about their contribution?

*Many individuals and teams were recognized, with frequent shout-outs to the EthPandaOps team for their tireless testing and devnet support, and to the EF testing and security teams for their crucial bug finding and coordination efforts. Specific developers who went above and beyond on challenging EIPs or during testnet incidents were also appreciated.*

**f. Pectra 1-3 words:**¬†In three words or fewer, how do you feel about Pectra being so close to complete?

*Common sentiments included ""relieved,"" ""challenging,"" ""anxious,"" ""excited,"" and a forward-looking desire for the next fork.*

**g. future priorities:**¬†Which protocol improvements should be prioritized in the near, medium, and/or long term? Why?

*Scaling, both L1 and L2, was overwhelmingly identified as the top priority for the near, medium, and long term to ensure Ethereum's continued growth and usability. Improving user and developer experience (UX/DevEx), exploring in-protocol privacy, and enhancing censorship resistance were also frequently mentioned.*

**h. future improvements:**¬†What should the core protocol community do to improve our processes in bringing future upgrades to mainnet?

*To improve future upgrades, respondents suggested earlier and more decisive scoping of forks, better estimation of EIP complexity, more efficient and inclusive ACD processes with clearer expectations and timelines, and increased testing and collaboration, including earlier devnets and more community involvement.*

1kne0ej,BTCS Inc. Secures $57.8 Million Convertible Note Facility to Expand Ethereum Holdings,"[BTCS Inc. (Nasdaq: BTCS)](https://www.btcs.com/news-media/convertible-note/), a blockchain technology firm, announced a $57.8M convertible note facility led by ATW Partners LLC to purchase Ethereum (ETH). The deal includes a $7.8M initial tranche, with up to $50M more available.

The convertible notes carry a fixed conversion price of $5.85 per share, which represents a 194% premium over the company's stock price of $1.99 on May 13, 2025. The notes are set to mature on May 13, 2027, and feature a 5% original issue discount along with a 6% annual interest rate.

In conjunction with the notes, BTCS has issued five-year warrants allowing the purchase of 1,901,916 shares of common stock at $2.75 per share, a 38% premium to the closing price on May 13, 2025.

Charles Allen, CEO of BTCS, has personally invested $95,000 in the offering, with an additional $200,000 coming from a trust for which he is a beneficiary. This move underscores the leadership's confidence in the company's strategic direction.

The primary purpose of this financing is to acquire more Ethereum tokens, which will enable BTCS to scale its validator node operations. By increasing its ETH holdings, the company aims to enhance its staking rewards and optimize block production through its proprietary Builder+ platform.

BTCS's approach mirrors that of other companies that have adopted cryptocurrencies as part of their treasury strategies, with a particular focus on Ethereum. This move comes at a time when institutional interest in digital assets continues to grow, and companies are looking for ways to integrate blockchain technology into their operations.",41,1747329989,ethereum,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1kne0ej/btcs_inc_secures_578_million_convertible_note/,3,neutral,0.5,

1kmcd6c,"It‚Äôs been only a week since Ethereum‚Äôs Pectra upgrade went live, and we‚Äôre already seeing big results in the implementation of EIP-7691.","Let‚Äôs break it down.  
  
A quick thread on how this proposal is making Ethereum more efficient, scalable, and affordable:

1/ **Blob fees dropped to near-zero.**  
  
If you recall, we took apart about **EIP-7691** in our Expainer series, and as we observe, before **Pectra**, median blob fees hovered around **1.43 gwei**.  
  
Now, they have dropped to **1 wei!** The minimum possible.  
  
This means much cheaper rollup operations and better UX for L2 users.

2/ **Blob capacity doubled**  
  
Upgrade increased the target number of blobs per block from **3 ‚Üí 6,** and the maximum from **6 ‚Üí 9.**  
  
Effectively doubling data availability for rollups.  
  
More blobs = more space for Layer 2s to post data = greater scaling capacity for the entire ecosystem.

3/ **Lower L2 utilization pressure.**  
The percentage of blob space being used fell from **\~55% to \~40%.**  
  
This drop may reflect both improved efficiency in data packaging and a temporary decrease in demand.  
  
Either way, the result is reduced congestion, fewer fee spikes during surges, and a seamless user experience.  
  
In short: data posting is now cheaper, smoother, and more predictable.

4/ **Pectra is doing exactly what it was designed to do. And this is just the beginning.**  
  
Big thanks to [@EntropyAdvisors](https://x.com/EntropyAdvisors), [@etherscan](https://x.com/etherscan) for surfacing early data.  
  
Your breakdown helped quantify just how impactful this upgrade already is.

1kle344,"How is rollup cheaper for non-smart contracts, one shot transactions?","This has been confusing me for a while. I can understand that rollups are cheaper for smart contracts, because they don't execute contracts on chain, but only do it when challenged (optimistic) or only doing the proof (zk)

I can also understand that they're cheaper if I stay in L2 for a while, making multiple transactions, and eventually they can be batched to lower everyone's cost.

What I can't understand is how this works for single shot transactions. Say I'm transfering X amount of eth from L1 address A to L1 address B through rollup, I imagine things go like this

1. I give the rollup mainter a transaction signed by my private key (off chain)
2. Roll up maintainer gather more transactions and batch th, compute the new l2 state (off chain)
2. The rollup maintainer call a smart contracts to
     1. update the inner state's Merkel tree in blob
     2. **actually execute the transaction**

Now 2.2 is what confused me. I can't imagine how it actually execute my transaction, without posting my signed transaction to the chain. If it does so, why is it cheaper than me posting it on chain myself?

I know that rollups can post some commitment of my signed transaction, but how can Ethereum execute a transaction with only a commitment? My money is not even in the smart contracts in the first place.

Thanks in advance! And please kindly point out if there's anything wrong in my assumptions.

ETA

People tell me it's not cheaper, which makes sense to me. However, I got this question because lately when I want to withdraw from an exchange, it offers 'Arbitrum' which is significantly cheaper

https://imgur.com/a/yVhObF8

The receiving side also offers Arbitrum, but the fees aren't shown there (which makes sense)

I suspect it's a marketing trick to subside my fee to make me locked in? I didn't try ot out though, because I don't feel comfortable transfering money through something I don't understand.",7,1747113888,ethereum,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1kle344/how_is_rollup_cheaper_for_nonsmart_contracts_one/,8,neutral,0.5,

1kk5xz1,Automatic authentication signature vs. EIP-712 message signing,"While developing EVMAuth, I was surprised to find this thread from 2019 that seems to have just been abandoned due to lack of interest. 

If Web3 app developers simply want to verify that a user owns an address (i.e. has the private key), why wouldn‚Äôt we want a mechanism to do this baked right into digital wallets that does not require human intervention?

I get that you don‚Äôt want your wallet just signing any old transaction blindly, but if there were a standard message format for this type of check, it would make user authentication trivial‚Ä¶and when you combine that with EVMAuth for authorization, it could render all other forms of auth obsolete!

1kj7h8r,Mina Graph Explorer ‚Äì Discover blockchain connections visually,"Hello !

Let me introduce **Mina Graph Explorer**

Mina Graph Explorer is a small open-source application (SPA/PWA/Responsive) I just developed, which lets you explore the blockchain in a fun and innovative new way.

The app is available here: [https://webapp.minagraph.com](https://webapp.minagraph.com) and can be used directly in your favorite web browser or installed as a PWA on mobile, tablet, or desktop.

Starting from a simple wallet address, it recursively explores all types of links to other addresses (smart contracts, native transactions, token transfers, etc.). The recursion depth is configurable, and the connections are displayed as a relational graph.

Currently, the following blockchains are supported: **Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and Mina Protocol**.

You can filter the display by link type, address, or time range, and view detailed information about each connection by clicking on a node.

The detail panel lists all connections with their types, and clicking on the connection type or block number opens the corresponding explorer (Etherscan, Polygonscan, etc.).

The explorer is multi-chain and allows you to trace movements from a single EVM-compatible address across all supported EVM blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC for now).
